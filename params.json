The Graphical inteface is built on SFML. \r\n\r\nBefore running the software please read the [Documentation] (http://abrarshariar.github.io/cpp_phone_documentation/index.html)\r\n\r\nCpp-Phone\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n*Synopsis*\r\n\r\nThis is a console based Phone software. The entire software is written in C++. For graphical interface SFML has been used. After you unpack the sofware the following directories is found:\r\n\r\n-C++Phone\r\n\r\n[Code] (https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/tree/master/Code)\r\n\t\r\n[Documentation](http://abrarshariar.github.io/cpp_phone_documentation/)\r\n\t\r\n[SFML] (https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/tree/master/SFML)\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn the \"Code\" subfolder the following header files are found:\r\n\r\n-Calculator.h\r\n\r\n-error.h\r\n\r\n-Methods.h\r\n\r\n-Options.h\r\n\r\n-Person.h\r\n\r\n-Phone.h\r\n\r\n-PhoneBook.h\r\n\r\n-PhoneCall.h\r\n\r\n-RegisterPerson.h\r\n\r\n-SFML.h\r\n\r\n-SMS.h\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides C++ Standard Library is extensively used. For more on each files please see the documentation.\r\nThe [Documentation](http://abrarshariar.github.io/cpp_phone_documentation/)  containes all the necessary doc files in .html format\r\nThe \"SFML\" folder contains the SFML library (version 2.1)\r\n\r\n\r\n*Compilation*\r\n\r\nIn order to use the C++Phone you must compile the main.cpp file included in the \"Code\" sub-folder. \r\n\r\nNOTE: You must read the followings (included in documentation) properly before compiling the software:\r\n\r\n[How to set up SFML] (http://abrarshariar.github.io/cpp_phone_documentation/howtoSFML.html)\r\n \r\n[How to run the sofware] (http://abrarshariar.github.io/cpp_phone_documentation/howtorun.html)\r\n\t\r\n[How it works](http://abrarshariar.github.io/cpp_phone_documentation/howitworks.html)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
