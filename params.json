The Graphical inteface is built on SFML. \r\n\r\n\r\nCpp-Phone\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n*Synopsis*\r\n\r\nThis is a console based Phone software. The entire software is written in C++. For graphical interface SFML has been used. After you unpack the sofware the following directories are found:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Code](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/tree/master/Code)\r\n\r\n[Documentation](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/tree/master/Documentation)\r\n\r\n[SFML](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/tree/master/SFML)\r\n\r\nIn the [Code](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/tree/master/Code) subfolder the following header files are found:\r\n\r\n-[Calculator.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/Calculator.h)\r\n\r\n-[error.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/error.h)\r\n\r\n-[Methods.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/Methods.h)\r\n\r\n-[Options.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/Options.h)\r\n\r\n-[Person.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/Person.h)\r\n\r\n-[Phone.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/Phone.h)\r\n\r\n-[PhoneBook.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/PhoneBook.h)\r\n\r\n-[PhoneCall.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/PhoneCall.h)\r\n\r\n-[RegisterPerson.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/RegisterPerson.h)\r\n\r\n-[SFML.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/SFML.h)\r\n\r\n-[SMS.h](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/blob/master/Code/SMS.h)\r\n\r\nBesides C++ Standard Library is extensively used. For more on each files please see the documentation.\r\nThe [Documentation](https://github.com/abrarShariar/Cpp-Phone/tree/master/Documentation) folder containes all the necessary doc files in .html format\r\nThe \"SFML\" folder contains the SFML library (version 2.1)\r\n\r\n\r\n*Compilation*\r\n\r\nIn order to use the C++Phone you must compile the main.cpp file included in the \"Code\" sub-folder. \r\n\r\nNOTE: You must read the followings (included in the documentation) properly before compiling the software:\r\n\r\n\t1) How to set up SFML\r\n\r\n\t2) How to run the sofware \r\n\r\n\t3) How it works\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
